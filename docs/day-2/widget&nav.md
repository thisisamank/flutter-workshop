### Flutter Material Design Widgets, Including the Scaffold Widget and Its Components

Flutter Material Design Widgets are a set of UI elements that adhere to the Material Design guidelines established by Google. These widgets are optimized for mobile devices and provide a consistent look and feel across all apps built with Flutter. One of the most important widgets in Material Design is the Scaffold widget, which serves as a container for the main elements of a screen, including the app bar, body, and bottom navigation.

```less
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
